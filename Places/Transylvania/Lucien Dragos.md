An Einherjar brought to [[Valhalla]] by [[Artemisia of Chronopolis]], he was forcibly turned into a vampire by [[Lilith]].  Upon learning of the transformation, Artemisia attempted to kill him with a silver weapon, forcing him to flee the city.  Now he rules over a prospering city in Transvylvania with his [[Heartsworn]], having found refuge in [[Mordred]]'s old castle.

+ The citizens are well fed and cared for.  Every month they pay a blood tax; Lucien collects blood for him and his Heartsworn, but never too much that it would kill anyone.
+ He gained insight from a fortune teller about a destined lover.  He believes Run is that lover when he first sees her
