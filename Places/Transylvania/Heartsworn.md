>The Heartsworn are individuals who were turned into lesser vampires by [[Lucien Dragos]].  They drank his blood, and because they drank from a source that was not directly the [[Grendel]], they are bond to Lucien exclusively.  While the Heartsworn maintain their personality, through phermones are they obedient and inclined to aid in Lucien's interest.
