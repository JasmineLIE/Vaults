A shapeshifter [[Lucien Dragos]] picked up for their ability, Charity is a [[Heartsworn]] who leads a hedonistic life while juggling worldscale espionage for their King.  They were subjected to Galanovan experimentation; the main goal of these experiments was to develop humans who could alter every cell within their body on command.  The facility they were kept in was abandoned at the height of the Scourge, and their body and mind were both suspended into stasis.  That was until Lucien discovered and freed them.
