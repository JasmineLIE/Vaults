A moon in the [[Sol System]] orbitting [[Uranus]]. [[Martholomew 'Marty' McKnight]]'s sister and mother were victims of [[Byron Tammerce]], alongside the [[Unknown Ariel Luminoth]]. When Marty came to retrieve them, [[Carolina (Frontiersmen)]] betrayed him in favor of a paycheck from Marty, leaving him to rot on the moon.

Later, [[Aitne Odhran]] was resurrected aboard the [[Fowler Rig]] and fought Tammerce, retrieving [[Eakarn]] from his turncoat [[Scald]].
