> Ganymede was once meant as a tropical paradise, fraught with jungles and creatures of Earth. However, as legend goes, during the [[Human-Nuuric War]], a child found the [[Unknown Ganymede Wishing Whale]] within its deepest caverns. It wished for a storm so great to sweep the invaders away, and to keep their home safe for an eternity. The Wishing Whale froze the moon with one great breath, leaving most of the planetary body covered in a forever-frozen jungle and vast seas of thick ice.
