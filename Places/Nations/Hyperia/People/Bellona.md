>*My youngest daughter, so brave and gallant in her dealings. Cruelty comes as a sword to you, for you were born to know no weakness and know well not to drink of the peasant's poison.* --Hypatia, the Gorgon Queen

Bellona was a [[Warlord]] local to [[Italy]] in the [[1st Age]] and [[2nd Age]]. Though [[Artemisia of Chronopolis]] crossed paths with her several times, she was never defeated by the Valhallan, and so she survived alone well into the 2nd Age before [[Hyperia]] expanded into Italy. [[Empress Hypatia, the Gorgon Queen]] forcibly adopted her, making her the sister of [[Angelo of Sparta]] and [[Cleo 'Fiona' Lionheart]]. She is the 'nemesis' of her brother [[Angelo of Sparta]], coming into conflict with him several times over.

Has known [[Merlin Weather]] through various hook-ups.
