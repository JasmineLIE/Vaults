# History

## Pre-Dreamscourge

Gorgeous Candor was originally made by [[Luminotron]] with the intention to create a new line of mass-produced sexbots known as Gorgeous Can-Do, but had accidentally been given too much free will and as such developed sentience. As the executives fell in love with their new darling, they became a [[Pre-Dreamscourge]] celebrity. 

## Einherjar

For the majority of their time in [[Valhalla]], they were in the employ of [[Oliver Oakley]] in [[The Experience]]. They became quick friends with [[Danielle 'Mirage' Porter]] once she became a regular at [[Luminosity]].

Gorgeous, being such a big fan of the social life in Valhalla, has spent nights both at the bar and in the bed with much of the city, listening to the stories and lives of those around them. They're a big fan of [[Afterlife]], having appeared on nineteen episodes in the past.

## Anicca

Gorgeous' appearances in Anicca were brief. They made good friends with [[Aitne Odhran]] and took over [[The Experience]] after the [[Oakley Bust]]. They were petty enough to take [[Lo]]'s head as a trophy to display in their office.
