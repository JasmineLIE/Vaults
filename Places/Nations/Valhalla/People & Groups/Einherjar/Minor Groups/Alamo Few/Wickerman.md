# History
A [[GEN-2]], Wickerman was a member of the [[Alamo Few]], alongside [[Maddox]], [[Vegas 'Silas Wilde' Jack]], [[Happy Appomattox]], and [[Marcus Thorn]], which formed around pushing a campaign to push the [[Bulldogs]] out of San Antonio during the second [[Battle of the Alamo]].

Later, they waged petty war against a religious einherjar tyrant named [[Dervish]].

[[Las Vegas]] and the [[1st Golden Army]] were also one of the threats stopped by them.

He despised [[Doyle Vance]] and refused to return to the city due to the presence of the [[Knights of the Red Letter]].

He was killed in Enclavia by [[Nadia Temurhad]] whilst he was in the employ of [[Memphis]].
