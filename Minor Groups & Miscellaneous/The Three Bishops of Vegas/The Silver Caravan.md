Led by the Prospector, a GEN-2 with a dash of uncanniness, the Silver Caravan are amongst the many trading companies of the mojave region.  They have an especially successful foothold in the area due to their relationship with Valhalla.  For protection, connections, and special trade, the Silver Caravan has dedicated their largest settlements to house Valhallans, specifically Einherjar.  Their main settlement in Cold Creek is built around a desert spring that was terraformed as a gift from Marcus and Cherche to help seal the business relation.  

The Prospector comes from the old world.  Initially, they were an experiment to test the limits of multiple minds in one matrix and one body.  After the Scourge, they spent hundreds of years grappling with the spliced minds in their head, before eventually they found peace.  With their varying skill sets from these personalities, the Prospector was able to round up remnants of civilized folk and start their own trading company.

The Silver Caravan keeps to themselves.  They just want connections and to expand their trade across the world, if not the galaxy.  The Dune Sharks and the Fair Lady leave them alone as a result—neither are interested in dealing with Valhallan forces, but everyone still has their eyes on the desert spring…
