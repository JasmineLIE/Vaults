One of many orders of the [[Knights of NASA]]. Located in the [[New Jersey Pine Barrens]].  They seek out 'Devils' to soothe, regarding themselves as peacekeepers between mortals and the supernatural.  While their purpose is rooted in hunting/soothing Fey, their delusion has spread to urban legends, like Bigfoot, New Jersey Devil, Lochness Monster, etc.

When the players approach them, they are fighting off [[Harvester]] from the abandoned military base they have stationed themselves in since arriving to New Jersey.  The military base contains old tech locked behind safes that they're still tring to crack.

At this point, they have lost [[Archdruid Sl√†ine Ernudec]] to [[Edith Bane]].  Believing the Bane Company responsible for the New Jersey Devil's unrest, they tried to strike the [[Pinelands Water Facility (Central Hub)]], but were quickly overwhelmed.  In their retreat, Ernudec was captured.  They pronounce her dead, and now the new Archdruid is her right-hand; [[Arcdruid Dorlamin]].

[[Initiate Sheelvong Kavanaugh]] is less than happy with this sudden change in leadership.  In her heart, Ernudec is her Archdruid, and she'll do anything to get her back, or die confirming her demise.
