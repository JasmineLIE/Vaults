Log 41131, Operation Isolation

  

Operative Logan Trevors continues pursuit of affiliates of the chapter of Knights of the Red Letter under Tevis Grey, leading them to a posh theatre within the Hyperian city of Korinthia. Target is Melody Merrithew-- one of the few Psirens that remain.

  

2000 hours, 22nd of March, 2898.

  

The sun had just began to set as Logan adjusted their coat, approaching the city’s edge. Staring up at the colossal statue of Angelo, erected in Hyperian Golds and laminated in Gessinian Pearls, Logan made quick note of the two ankhs, one in each hand, likely a cultural addition after Hyperia’s acquisition of the Egyptian territories. Though it was positioned out in the Korinthian bay, it towered a whopping 350 feet-- a testament to Hyperian wealth, the flaming eyes ensuring visibility miles out.

Logan bit their lip, narrowing an eye. “A bit overindulgent, wouldn’t you say?”

Logan, LaFaye asked, ignoring their question, intangibly tapping her fingers together. I’ve checked everything-- she’s the last one.

Logan smiled. "Noted," they turned, adjusting their coat over their vest. "Perhaps, after this, we can go to Chronopolis? I've been wanting to have the oracles look into my future.”

Logan, focus-- and we still have the invitation after this.

“Ah, yes, quite-- the invitation. We mustn’t forget!” They said, turning and approaching the Dionysus Theatre, built from natural magics-- the building itself made of warped and manipulated trees-- a beautiful roof of forest canopies capable of casting sunlight down upon the stage around noontime.

A Hyperian Soldier glanced at them as they entered, “Enjoy the show.” he said, opening the doors for them.

Quick glances and swifter introspection allowed Logan to realize just how many people were going to be present-- perhaps the most multicultural group they had seen within the country since infiltrating. Quite an audience. He thought.

Yeah. Won’t be an issue, though, if we do it right. LaFaye said back.

Logan stepped into the theatre. The show hadn’t begun yet-- green curtains of vines stretched over the stage, but many had already been seated. Any sight? They wondered.

LaFaye nodded mentally. Second floor. The viewing box at the very end. 

Logan glanced up-- a woman in a blue dress with even bluer eyes sat alone, a tired yet happy look to her. An immense and telling relief was visible in her eyes to any who gave her more than a glance.

And so it begins. Logan remarked with a brief snicker, turning and making their way back down through the wooden halls-- all the way to the very end of the hall. Faced with the locked door, they smirked-- unlocking it with a click of their mind quietly and slipping in with nary a sound, taking a seat behind the woman. Leaning forward, they spoke softly but firmly. "Miss Melody," they smiled, "A pleasure.”

The woman bit her lip. "Ah," she glanced over her shoulder, "Master Trevors."

They nodded, "As I am, or, ‘In the flesh,’ as some may say," they whispered softly into Melody's ear, "Have you enjoyed the show thus far?"

She closed her eyes, a cold acceptance settling over her. "I suppose it's been sufficient." she blinked thrice before continuing, "We've still a good several minutes before my favorite scene."

Logan checked their watch. "I suppose, then, we shall make the time for it, milady?"

The woman smiled softly, even though they couldn't see it. "Of course." she said, lidded eyes dragging open and closed.

Logan looked around for and then held up some theatre glasses, giving a smirk to Melody as she gave a glance back to their shifting movement. “Cheers, hm?” they whispered, giving their eyes to the show for almost twenty minutes-- a comedy that certainly caught the attention of the crowd. Watching Melody, they made note of her laughing-- though her situation gave it a hollow air, they knew she was at the very least gathering some final bouts of happiness. 

When the scene had ended, her hands clasped one-another as she sucked in her cheeks. Glancing back over her shoulder again, there was a weary look to her wariness. "I suppose there isn't any way out of this, is there?"

"None by which I wouldn't catch you, I'm afraid." they said, checking their watch. "It's about time, Miss Melody."

"I see," she exhaled, smelling the rosey air of the theatre and taking in one last glance at the happy guests. "Go on, then."

"If you insist." Logan shrugged, forming a knife of bismuth and plunging it into her heart-- a shadowed hand that didn't belong to themselves covering her mouth. She struggled for a moment, as if to escape her impalement-- eventually, as all things do, she stopped struggling.

That’s that, then. LaFaye remarked. We should probably make haste.

I would agree. Should we worry about cleaning up after ourselves?

Whatever for? We’re leaving the country, aren’t we?

Ah, I suppose you have a fair point, my dear LaFaye. Logan smiled, adjusting their coat oncemore-- and taking their leave through the same way they came.

“Not one for the show, aye?” asked the guardsman as they walked by.

Logan smirked, closing their eyes-- dissuaging an awkward laugh. Turning, they glanced up at the sky in thought. “I suppose I just--” they sucked in the corner of their mouth, snapping with a bigger smile back. “--didn’t get it.” they said, turning once more, Doyle-bound. . .
