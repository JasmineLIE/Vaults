The STARGAZER set of satellites were a [[Pre-Dreamscourge]] endeavor.

## Luminoth Research

[[Karyll]] was the first Luminoth to have been studied by humanity, and was promptly made into the Thermolight Cannon.

Later, [[Caracen]], a warrior dispatched to find Karakayenne was acquired by them, and subsequent interviews did not succeed.

## The Dreamscourge

As the Dreamscourge hit, Caracen fell dormant-- singing a neverending song that ended up being picked up [[Mendicant Order]] Nuuric as they arrived in the system. They eradicated what was present on the station and took Caracen into their own holdings.

## Post-Scourge

The satellite was infested with [[Shock Leech]]es and held a number of [[Luminotron Attendants]].

[[Jane Doe]] utilized STARGAZER-09 to entrap [[Laloon]] with a small troupe of [[Crimson Hornets]].
