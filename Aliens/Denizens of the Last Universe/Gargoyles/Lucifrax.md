## The Cycle of Woe

Lucifrax was the leader of the [[Gargoyle]]s who attacked Nurema. While he was gravely injured, he ultimately survived and absconded to the new universe alongside his kin.

## Present Day

While his fate is unknown, Lucifrax is seeking out [[Judgment]], where [[Alexander White]] and [[Pazmina Merrin]] dwell. This leads him into conflict with Recovery One and Recovery Two.
