## The Cycle of Woe

Lucifrax was the leader of the [[Gargoyle]]s who attacked Nurema, using [[Asmodeus]], [[Sedit]], and [[Dantalion]] to bolster his strength in the [[Blood Hunt]]. While he was gravely injured by [[Nurema]] after she became [[Lilith]], he ultimately survived and absconded to the new universe alongside his kin.

## Present Day

Lucifrax is responsible for the [[Mechanovore, Enlighted]] growth in the hopes of creating a living armor.

Lucifrax is seeking out [[Judgment]], where [[Alexander White]] and [[Pazmina Merrin]] dwell. This leads him into conflict with Recovery One and Recovery Two. He continues to hunt Lilith and the rest of the Grendel.
