Prior to transferring themself to the next dimension, they served as counsel for [[Lucifrax]], aiding in the [[Blood Hunt]] for Nurema. Once it was clear she was to be the victor, however, Asmodeus absconded and ran into the next dimension.

He eventually reconvened with Lucifrax, beginning the hunt for [[Lilith]] alongside Lucifrax and [[Sedit]]. He poses as the wife of [[Nanjala, Paragon of Water]] to better persuade her into falling into his schemes.
