## The Cycle of Woe

Dantalion was advisor to [[Gestalt]] on the Cherubim [[Spirit World]]. He did not aid in the battle, instead reciting the [[Esoterica]] to Gestalt and then later allowing [[Urm]] to read of its contents. He, like the rest of the Gargoyles, absconded to the new universe.

## Present Day

Dantalion is present in the Sol System, but his exact whereabouts are currently unknown.
