## The Cycle of Woe

Dantalion was advisor to [[Gestalt]] on the Cherubim [[Spirit World]]. He did not aid in the battle, instead reciting the [[Esoterica]] to Gestalt and then later allowing [[Urm]] to read of its contents. Before he could escape to the new universe, however, he was contacted by [[Lucifrax]] to aid in the [[Blood Hunt]] against [[Nurema]]. While he did not plan to aid them in truth, he did recognize the danger [[Urm]] presented in having read the [[Esoterica]] following Nurema's consumption of its ink. As such, he took a gift of one of the new gods ([[The Leviathan]]) and used its blood to write Urm's death into every universe, forcing him to collapse. Shortly after betraying Lucifrax and killing Urm, he escaped into the new universe.

## Present Day

Dantalion is present in the Sol System, but his exact whereabouts are currently unknown.
