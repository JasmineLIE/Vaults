## The Cycle of Woe

Nuvok is the son of Nugammon. Though it is not so much a biological connection as it is 'chosen,' Nugammon very much adored him and taught all that he knew to young Nuvok.

The Grendel Warrior followed his father on a warpath through the Cherubim hierarchy slaughtering all that stood in their way, until they came up with the plan to destroy the [[Spirit World]]. After placing a bomb in one of the Spirit World's moons, he was slaughtered by Gestalt in a fit of rage. 

However, Urm snapped the [[Nudibranch]]'s wishbone, wishing that all the Grendel killed by Gestalt's onslaught would be brought back, thus erasing Nuvok's first death. He and his father plunged the Spirit World into the Dream, creating a rift massive enough to vacuum everything nearby inside. It was here he earned the title 'the Moonbreaker.'

Whilst Nuvok ultimately survived, his father died in migration, thus earning him the title 'the Shamed.'
