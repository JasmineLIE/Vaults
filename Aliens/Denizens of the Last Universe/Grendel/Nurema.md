## The Cycle of Woe

Nurema is the mother of all Grendelkind, and it is from her blood that she concocted more of their spawn within the hidden hives scattered across the universe. She despised how her brothers wasted time away at war instead of aiding her with her people, but found renewed faith when her brother's machinations proved to bear fruit.

When she attempted to gather her young and follow, she was caught in an ambush led by the cunning [[Lucifrax]]. While she managed to kill most of her adversaries and injure Lucifrax, he was ultimately able to escape into the new universe alongside his kin.

In consuming the hundreds of hearts of her adversaries, she was overpowered by them and became a greater being: [[Lilith]].

## Present Day

Nurema, or Lilith, powers Yggdrasil with her energy. Since it weakens her, she can do nothing to break free, despite her efforts to convince [[Doyle Vance]] to listen to her.
