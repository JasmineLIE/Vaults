I

Summation

  

We are GRENDEL. 

  

Children of the Deep. Voice of the Old. Harbinger of the Beyond. The last flesh that dares to remain in the universe.

  

I am URM, first of my kind. The Whisper of Whetheket, he whose voice tore down ancient stone. I am oldest sibling of the tribunal. I give unto my people HUNGER.

  

My brother is NUGAMMON. The Living Grave, the one whose flesh is not his own. He is wicked in his ways, and gives unto my people INSTINCT. 

  

My sister is NUREMA. The Eater of Stars, she whose existence warms our chitin. She is the youngest. She gives unto my people AMBITION. 

  

These three things define us. We are beasts. Our enemies do not forget this. We are not welcome among them. To this end, we will live in shadows and die in shadows. We are not worried, but time grows short.

  

The light is a home for those weak enough to require it. What they do not understand is that there is room only for us.

  

Anu Amal Arak. “Blessed, Old, Forever.”

  

II

Afraid of the [LIGHT]

  

Remember, my children, the teachings of NUGAMMON: darkness is our shield. “We cannot die under the black sky.” That is what we were told— this evertruth prevails in the face of the dangers above. 

  

THE FINAL SUN. All Light is pretty, especially when its embrace has become so rare. But it must be avoided. Your flesh will sear and you will be left during migration. 

  

THE MOONS. The Irid Lo, Irid Irkaj, and Irid Akerris. Reds and blues dancing in the sky. Do not go out when they are there. The lamphounds will see you.

  

LAMPHOUNDS. Beasts with no eyes that walk upon six legs. Their appendage, a lamp stalk, will beckon you forward. Do not listen.

  

DUST BLADE STORM. The sand is sharp and our muscles exposed. If you are out in a storm, your remains will be left in migration.

  

GEZHAK-AR. They are the words for “Endless War.” We live in it every day. Our adversaries blame the end on us. 

  

Every creature in the galaxy looks to us like they do monsters. We are not monsters. We are an Empire Without End.

  

EMPIRE WITHOUT END. This is us. We are the last flesh of this realm we shall be the first in the next.

  

Nugammon’s final decree was simple: this realm is temporary. Migration is our ultimate end. Judge your actions as if only you may bring it to pass.

  

Anu Amal Arak.

Anu

  

My brothers waste time away at war. Urm searches for the ever-ons and Nugammon cries to an uncaring void so that it may grant mercy— and so it falls to me to protect the spawn, for they are too brash to turn their gaze back.

  

My star-stolen magicks have grown weak and sputtered, my marrow yellowing. I live in fear, but none know but I. Cherubim hunt us without end. I hang from above, just as the rocks around me, in ponderance.

  

My swarmchildren look up at me without eyes. Our teeth have no lips to conceal, and so our cries are guttural and pained, our muscles bare and twitching as the dust and ash of the open air stings ligament and vessel.

  

Though they were not built to think, I see in their nine hearts wonder. They beat one at a time, rapid, the nine-knives upon the marrowmind. I see in them inspiration.

  

They know the reason we lay in the dark, as so we all. Wicked creatures live in the last lights— the same bright that burns— and so we have fled to a distant warplanet, Kel-Anur. The skies above the cavern thrum with the shrill-screeches of the Lamphounds. My children give fearing coos as they huddle beneath me.

  

The warriorkin return to the cavehive with sand grit between their capillaries, mouths stuck in the truegrin painting a postured look. Though their bodies burn from dustblades, they worry not. Our lives have always required pain through service.

  

They step forward, four-tongues chittering curses and whispers as they drop a thing to the ground. It is one of the cherubim. I look back, and see lightscars cleaved through the warriorkin fleshwalls. This will not do.

  

I look to the Cherub. He tells me his name is Ormar, and the Dreamseers would notice his absence. His words mean nothing to me. He is fed to the children.

  

Another is dropped by the warriorkin. It is a gargoyle, wicked and eight-armed. It defies the rules of flesh through its indulgence. It begs to speak. I allow it.

  

She says her name is Amelle, and her daughters will miss her if she falls. She says her family needs her to survive the dreams to come. Her children may need her, but mine need her more. Her existence ends.

  

So the children learn my first teaching: morality and necessity, the two aspects of CHOICE. I never wanted to kill anyone, but we crave meat and they had much to give, and so a choice was made. Such acts define things beyond our flesh, a brand upon the ever-ons, to be remembered til migration.

  

Anu Amal Arak.

Amal

  

Hark, fools! No matter your creed or history, the word of Urm rings true. The death throes of this universe are upon us. Can you not feel the very air sprout its wings and speak of soft dreams? Pay mind and hear how they tell of pretty songs and laced futures, and realize the cruelty of their ballad: we are absent.

  

They will undo us for we are without a true dream. Our people have never known its power and beauty until recent, and so without its blessing, without her care, we will be left without a migration.

  

It is to this end, then, that I begin my quest: I shall personally bear witness to the edge of the cosmos, where the wave of death stretches and the where rests the graveyard of all that we know. 

  

I do this, my family, because I love you. Our quests have been too cruel and our lives too painful to allow for failure. 

  

We will not be forgotten. 

  

Anu Amal Arak.

Arak

  

To my son, Nuvok: Violence begets violence. This was the first thing your motherflesh demanded you learn.

  

It is why we must kill all that we see. In my many eons across many galaxies, I have encountered no foe worthy of stalling my nine deadly hearts. Nugammon, they would cry, you are a monster! You eat our children and demand too great of tribute. You must die! It was always their last words. No warning would dissuade them.

  

So cruel it is to be among us, to know that we are the apex of reality’s design! There exists no challenge for a creature like me. My perfection is innumerated only by the flawlessness of my deeds. 

  

Even now, as I face the Jagrelli remnants, I recognize they too are fleeing the death waves. Urm’s warning did well to preserve them as food. Though he did not expect me to pick them off as I do, he still eats of their flesh when I bring it back to Kel-Anur. 

  

See, Nuvok, my second lesson: strength demands respect. We are the greatest not just of our kind but of the remaining cosmos! There is no one who can tell you or I ‘no.’ We are without closure.

  

Ha! Even now, look how they whimper and wheeze beneath our boot for death. What they do not understand is that through this carnage we not only gain food but we prove to the universe that we are fit for this new beginning. Through this wisdom, so shall mercy be granted to our eggs.

  

Anu Amal Arak, my friends. There is room only for us. Such is the demand of MERCY.

  

VI

Pain

  

Behold the first tenet of Urm, sad and wicked as it is, for it is the barest expression of oneself. Nurema hides behind her CHOICE, and Nugammon behind his MERCY, but PAIN is the first thing all creatures feel, and the last. When all else fails, there shall be pain, writhing and wriggling beneath the skin of all that lives.

  

Urm was no stranger to pain-- his flesh was burnt, stricken raw by the blades of Cherubim and gargoyle fangs, his sister Nurema and brother Nugammon less than half his size. His robes stretched high, dirtied with the speckles of the Gezhak-Ar.

  

The edge of the universe, vast and empty, did not stare back into him. Gentle fears strangled his throat as he drifted away from the Ever-Ons.

  

Nugammon was always impatient, and his words echoed always. Though his voice was boisterous, the proximity to the death wave gave him great fear. “There is nothing here. We should turn back before we can no longer see which way is home.”

  

Nurema was worried, as was her duty as mother of the peoples. “We must consider the children. If we do not return, they will surely perish. To pursue this end is irresponsible.”

  

Their voices awoke a great and terrible thing. From an endless void, a spearfinned beast ripped and tore through the nilwinds, swirling thousands upon thousands of stolen lights along its flesh. Like a vicious and monstrous rainbow whipping through the abyss, it flew itself to the edge of the end, its millions of shimmering eyemouths releasing a gently raging screech. A terrible and old voice ripped through the Grendel’s mind.

  

:: VO-KREN BREAK AWAY IN HOPES TO FIND BETTER LIFE ::

:: YOU WILL FIND NOTHING IN THIS PIT ::

:: TURN BACK FLESHLING ::

:: YOUR STORY HAS ENDED ::

:: RETURN TO YOUR CHILDREN, SO YOU MAY COMFORT THEM BEFORE THEY TOO TURN TO DUST ::

  

//

  

Urm stood tall, breath heavy and grisly. The blood of his kills still lined his teeth. 

  

Anu Amal Arak. We will not break on the wave. I am Urm, he who slew a million and one with but a whisper. I will not turn back. I will not relent. My children crave LOVE and I will seek it, no matter your power, Nudibranch.

  

:: I CLAIM NO POWER ::

:: I GIVE UNTO YOU ONLY WARNING ::

:: THE END WILL COME REGARDLESS OF YOUR PURSUIT ::

  

//

  

You are wrong! Migration will save us. We are Grendel, born of the kidneys of a dying God. Cease your doomsaying and we will speak as the Wingkings do.

  

:: URM, NUGAMMON, NUREMA ::

:: CREATURES THREE ::

:: ONE BOUND BY STARVATION, ONE BOUND BY SCOPE, ONE BOUND BY NATURAL LAW::

:: THIS UNIVERSE IS ENDING. SOON A NEW SHALL TAKE ITS PLACE ::

:: AND YOU WILL BE LEFT BEHIND, LITTLE MEAT. ::

  

//

  

What dare you get at, Nudibranch of the void? We are bound by nothing but our will. We stole a Cherubim cruiser and sailed a grand voyage into the dark in search of an answer, before your ignorance tore us a new problem!

  

:: THE CREATURES THREE WILL NOT DO ::

:: THIS SHIP WILL NOT DO ::

:: YOUR MIGRATION WILL BRING YOU NO PEACE ::

  

//

  

Speak truths, beast! Your riddles and rigorithms confuse my siblings, and upset them. Even now fear coos from their chatterwhites.

  

:: I CAN OFFER YOU NOTHING BUT LIES AND COMFORT BEFORE THE END :: 

:: IN THE EDGE, ALL THAT I PROCLAIM IS LAW ::

:: THIS IS A PLACE BEYOND GODS ::

:: BEYOND THEIR CREATIONS ::

:: HOME TO THINGS BEFORE EVEN THEY DARED TO BE BORN ::

  

//

  

Silence and be rid of yourself, before we make work of you! We shall tolerate your silly ramblings no longer. Remain in our way and you shall face the truths we carry!

  

:: I HAVE SEEN A MILLION UNIVERSES LITTLE WORM ::

:: AMONG THEM NONE DID STAND WHEN THE FINAL HAND BECKONED ::

:: YOU AND YOURS SHALL BE NO DIFFERENT ::

  

//

  

And so Urm’s jaw fell three feet, his thousand-teethed maw opening and amplifying the full might of his screech. The black void rippled like water at the sheer weight of his pitch, the cosmos cracking as though a hammer tore through it.

  

For a moment, the Nudibranch’s body exploded into a rainbow flurry of every color that ever existed, and then without pause its bones stabbed its heart and propelled it into the abyss. It was from here, then, that his anger gave him the answer he needed. Urm took its most valued remnant as a child would a prize: the wishbone.

  

Anu Amal Arak. So began the migration.
