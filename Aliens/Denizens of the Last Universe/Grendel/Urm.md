## The Cycle of Woe

The spiritual leader of the Grendel, Urm was tasked with doing the impossible and he made good of it. His whisper shattered the Gargoyle world of [[Whetheket]], inspiring it to combust from the inside out and shatter at his call.

When the Anicca was threatening to destroy the universe, he went to the edge of the known cosmos and met the [[Nudibranch]]. When he achieved a disagreement, he whispered and destroyed its form and took its wishbone.

He later used the wishbone to resurrect [[Nugammon]] and [[Nuvok]] when they were slaughtered by [[Gestalt]], reading of the [[Esoterica]] alongside [[Dantalion]] as the migration began.

## Present Day

Urm's ultimate state is unknown, but his heart was shaped into the Holy Grail.
