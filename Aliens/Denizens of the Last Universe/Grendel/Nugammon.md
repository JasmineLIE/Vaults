## The Cycle of Woe

Nugammon was the brash and terrible military leader of the Grendel, and drank deep of opportunities to kill his enemies. He led many successful military assaults against the Cherubim, ultimately leading to the death of [[Gestalt]]. He and his son [[Nuvok]] dropped the [[Spirit World]] into the abyss of space, creating a rift so great that it sucked the world into the Dream.

Shortly before the Migration could take place, Nugammon was killed by [[Lucifrax]] and forged into a sword capable of wounding [[Nurema]].
