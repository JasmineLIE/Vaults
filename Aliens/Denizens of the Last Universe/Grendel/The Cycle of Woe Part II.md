VII

Cherub

  

Behold, you wretches, for I am Gestalt: the most valorous and honorable creature within these spaces. The Cherubim bow to me and my thousand husband-wives alone.

  

My claws of light have been sharpened on darkened wiseries too much as of late. My fingers bear the spines of my enemies, sharpened so precisely as to rip through flesh and soul with but a swing. Though their use brings me much glee, words shall win over their feeble deeds. 

  

Hear me, my fellow Cherubim— interdimensional ichor courses through our veins. Our gods gave us their power as their final gifts. We shall not waste them in death! The Grendel seek to escape a shared end, and they will stop at nothing to tear everything and everyone in their way to ribbons. The last great Spirit World must be protected at all costs!

  

I will not let them. If our realm is destined for death, then we shall all be made sibs fore the last sun shall set upon the last world. 

  

Save your speeches for your victory, fool! My people have already arrived. It is with shame that I come with purpose so that I cannot take pride in eradicating your bright-born race. 

  

Nugammon! Your logic-treachery surprises none. You may conjure visions of your form to terrify our lowest, but we outnumber your damned race a billion to one. Your warriors fall like weeds to a foreleg! You stand no match against our full might. How can you so brazenly challenge extinction?

  

Alas! Were it so easy for you to understand: only my highforms remain. Only the weak and brittleboned are killed by your troubled fruit-skinned hubris. These who stand with me have seen a thousand worlds bathed in the darkness of the Aniccarium; the Spirit World shall be the next, and it shall be glorious: one final spectacle for all our miserable companions in this universe to see. We do not need soldiers or armaments to put your people to the sword; mere desire shall enchant the key to your damnation.

  

Very well, then-- come high and come hard, and we shall meet by swordside!

  

And so the Battle for Eden began.

Father to Son

  
  

Nugammon wasted no time. The Spirit World was the heart of the Cherubim Paradigm; to savor the endeavor would be to allow failure into the equation.

  

THE SOULSTORM. The first threat they faced. The Cherubim ancestors surrounded the entire world like clouds, providing breathable air and guidance to their beneficiaries, but also providing the ultimate defense— for a soul could not be pierced by any normal weapon. 

  

THE CHERUBIM CRUISERS. The second threat to Grendelkind’s destiny.  The Cherubim fleets were legendary, entire temple-hives ordered into hundreds of beautiful symphonious creations. Within these the Cherubim soothsayers would pray to their holy ones, empowering themselves off of their zeal.

  

GHOST WORMS. The final threat.  They had been long since domesticated and were trained to hunt fleshthings and iron-blooded monsters, of which both encompassed the Grendel being.

  

It was risky. But his plan was sound. He had learned from his siblings well, and so he danced as Nurema did, for the Spirit World was so vast and grand that three million moons orbited its grandeur. One would be enough to make an entrance in the storm.

  

So it was then that Nugammon turned to his son Nuvok, who had felt much need to prove himself as a worthy leader, and told him this: Nuvok, O Son of mine, you shall be the hand which brings about eternity for our people. I have done my best to teach you, as has the rest of our family, but the time has come for you to do as I have told you and not as you have listened. Do you understand?

  

Nuvok nodded, for disappointing his father and his fleshsibs would be the greatest failure of all, and so he took a million Grendel and a Fleshtomb and said “I will kill whatever stands in my way, for that is the right thing to do.”

  

Anu, Amal, Arak.

Scholars Unseen

  

Gestalt had spent days watching the Grendel advance. His mandibles chirped with anxiety again and again until his husband-wives demanded that he seek his finest counsel once again: so it was, then, that Dantalion found himself in the highest temple amidst the tallblades.

  

Dantalion! Gestalt’s loving embrace graced the Gargoyle, Our people are worried. The Grendel work a dark plan on the outskirts of our starless world. Will the Ancestors protect us?

  

Dantalion peered into his finest work, the Esoterica which catalogued all that was and would be, and cleared his throat. What difference does it make? He asked, They are outside your world and hunger for the sweet taste of your blood. If they come, you will either have war or you will have a mess to clean. You must be ready regardless.

  

Gestalt did not like the answer. Do we make it through this? Be honest with me, friend, as you always have, for they brim too much with confidence and I fear recourse. The Gods have fallen silent, just as you predicted.

  

Indeed, Dantalion chuckled, the Gods have fallen silent because they too have died, Gestalt. The Anicca spares none in its wrath.

  

You did not answer me, friend-- I beg of you, please, do we make it?

  

You wish to know the truths etched within the Esoterica, Gestalt? You shall have it: the Grendel will die here, but it will not be the end of this war. You too shall perish, and so shall the rest of your delicious species.

  

Impossible! Gestalt was furious at the answer. How could we die if the Grendel have fallen? Is it the Anicca which brings us to heel?

  

No, my friend, Dantalion chuckles. It shall be those which you destroyed.

Rage

  

Run! Run, cried the Cherub soldiers, Nuvok has arrived!

  

The son of Nugammon was a brute unlike any other. He had none of the calculation that his father had but all of the hatred and so his wrath was certainly terrible, beyond those of his kin. He fed on the flesh of the Hopper Knights and drank deep of the juice of the Priestwings, growing even more great in mass as he rampaged across the moon.

  

The bomb, a cube of coalesced hope dreamt from the thoughtpuddles of his fallen nine-hearted brothers and sisters and crafted from the Cherubim chitin, was planted at the hollow-heart of the moonhive and left to ponder the weight of its existence. Nuvok and his elite trudged out, ready to beckon his father for retrieval when the holy lance of Gestalt curved and snapped to stab into all of his hearts at once.

  

Die, nightmare! Gestalt cried, his rage curdling his blood-juice. Your people will have nothing!

  

Nuvok fell. His brothers and sisters turned to dust with the holy light of Gestalt now upon them, leaving him alone on the barren surface save for his killer, whose eight golden eyes burned his own bone into ash slowly. He wanted the son of Nugammon to suffer, and suffer he did.

  

Not even Nugammon’s arrival could save him. The Grendel hierarch and the Cherubim Brightlord stared at each other, the ash-covered body of Nuvok between them-- and then the most horrible thing graced the sky.

  

Stars.

  

No, explosions! Gestalt’s anger had demanded the Grendel cease existence, and his will was so great and terrible that all of Nugammon’s men turned to dust and there was naught a thing he could do! The Grendel looked to the Brightlord, and then to his fallen son, and fell to his knees. 

  

You have won! My people will die alone and you shall have the terrible waste of the universe to yourself.

  

I would have it no other way, you overgrown maggot! Gestalt cried back, slicing the lord’s head from his shoulders and stomping out the last of Nugammon’s brood.

  

But that never happened.

  

What? Gestalt felt the ground around him shake. What do you mean?

  

The snapping of a bone crackled across the universe, like a scream so terrible it forced all who heard it to break thought.

  

From his own ashes, Nuvok stood, joined by his father. The stars graced the sky a second time and then there were none yet again. Gestalt’s heart stopped. What have they done? What terrible powers have they conquered?!

  

And so Nuvok became Moonbreaker, for Gestalt’s thoughts were too slow to be answered.

  

XI

Hubris

  

Urm’s coming shook the universe, for the wishbone had frightened the Dream into compliance, just as he had ordained. Nugammon’s plan to drop the Spirit World into the Dream, opening a vacuum to absorb their kin would go uninterrupted. Still, the problem most present to him was Dantalion, Gestalt’s most trusted counsel, for while the Brightlord had fallen Dantalion had every intention of staying on the Spirit World through its imperial collapse.

  

The Gargoyles had flocked like gnats to a carcass, coming swift through the universe as the hole had been opened, the Cherubim that once stood as a mighty bastion now eaten alive by desperate and terrified spirits amidst a shattered dream. It was clear they intended to follow the Grendel into this gap, and Urm had every intention of ensuring that they would falter. 

  

Nuvok and Nugammon stood before the rift, father and son watching fireworks with joyous intent as the Spirit World fell into nonlinearity and shattered the very fabricstuffs that pervaded the universe. 

  

Urm saw this, and did laugh greatly, for his brother had finally found joy without murder, even though much had died in the way of such things.

  

Dantalion made himself known to Urm, for he knew the Hierarch demanded his existence be made consequential, and so he gave bow and nod to the forebear of Grendelkind. Tell me, o Urm the great and powerful, what would you ask of Dantalion?

  

Your sibkind, the Gargoyles. They would disrupt our own migration in favor of their own treachery. You will tell them to turn back.

  

I am afraid I can do no such thing, for the Esoterica has already decided we are both to survive and but one Cherub shall make it through; Alas, your hubris has damned us all to continue again in a new existence, a curse to blight a new generation of hapless mortals. Do you not see the frightful issue with your action?

  

Urm’s claws curled as he braced his word. Your book is one I have heard my sister read fairy tales to spawnlings of. May I see it, here, before the end of all things and before our great descension?

  

Perhaps, as a final gift to this universe, its knowledge-filled chronologies may grace another; t’was a curse to be alone in knowing, anyway. 

  

And so Dantalion handed it to Urm, who did read much of its contents: it told a song of trees and of immortal mortals who would battle the ever-ons as he and his sibs had, and so he shut the book, for The Cycle of Woe would repeat again: the Anicca would strike and more would battle it, and there was futility in such things.

  

Perhaps it is better to leave some things alone, he told Dantalion as he gave the book back, and so the Gargoyle did smile and nod back, saying It is already too late, my bone-mottled friend, for we now bear the same curse, and the Esoterica has marked you for an eternity; so too shall its knowledge haunt your dreams and nightmares. In this, we are kin forever, and I say we must abscond as such family.

  

Not yet, Urm did cry. I must retrieve my sister, for she has our brood and without them our kind will be sure to perish in the next reality.

  

Dantalion did nod, and so the two took separate paths from extinction: one to a sib and one through a rift.
