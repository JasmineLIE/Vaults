>The child of one of [[King Morgan 'Arthur' La Faye]]'s Witch-Wives, [[Morgause]].  She was born a girl out of wedlock.  That, coupled with an absence of magick capabilities, she was discarded.  At an early age she was taken in by [[Lovely 'Galahad' Weather]] who raised her like his own daughter into Knighthood.

+ Accompanied Galahad on his quest for the [[Holy Grail]] with his other Squires.  
+ Upon reaching the Grendel artifact, it had killed all of Galahad's Squires, save for her, as she had stood beside him and was protected by him.  The artifact absorbed the blood of the fallen and renewed itself, offering Galahad immortality.  
+ Horrified, they left the Grail.  Galahad gifted her half his heart to ensure no one else would be able to track the Grail.  The half he gives her holds his negative emotions; the [[Ladies Of The Lake]]'s' strife and thirst for vengeance.  She leaves for Transylvania
+ Merlin approaches her later.  He lies, telling her that Galahad had been slain by King Arthur, and goads her into eating the heart.  She eats it, but she does not turn into an iteration of Galahad as he hoped.
+ Her soul is perserved by his love for her, and powered by the Magicks from his heart, her vengeance grows stronger, and she challenges Morgan in [[Avalon]].
+ Mordred horrifies Morgan because she has no honour to spare.  Their intense duel creates a fork in the Dream where both outcomes happen; Mordred's and Arthur's success.
+ This butterfly effect lingers with Mordred-- it is present in her theme-- and after killing Arthur she retreats to her manor in Transylvania.
