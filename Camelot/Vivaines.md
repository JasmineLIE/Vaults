Birthed from the [[Ladies Of The Lake]] certain branch of magic, Vivaines are the product of their intense love and emotion in which they held for each other.  Cultivated carefully in the Gardens of Avalon, these flowers hold certain magical properties reflected in the colour of their petals.

Vivaines came before their Earthly, mundane rose counterparts.  The Ladies would give Vivaines to kind hearted travellers as tokens of protection and fortune.  The Vivaines wilted outside of Avalon, but from their compost came roses.

After [[King Morgan 'Arthur' Le Fey]] slew the Ladies and seized Avalon, the Vivaines dulled in her presence, harbouring nightmarish magicks and properties instead.  Once they grew because of the Ladies’ love, now they grow by their everlasting pain.
