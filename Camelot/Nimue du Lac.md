> One of the remaining survivors of the [[Ladies Of The Lake]], Nimue was spared by [[King Morgan 'Arthur' La Faye]] solely because she was the mother of [[Lancelot du Lac]], and for her talents in Magick.  After he betrayel, where she attempted to steal [[Lovely 'Galahad' Weather]] away, but was stopped by [[Merlin Weather]] and [[Gawain]], her head was severed and preserved.  It is currently in [[Sir Kay]]'s posession, which he uses to trap his victims into her mental fortress.  The rest of her body is sealed in an iron maiden casted under the ocean near Cardiff.
