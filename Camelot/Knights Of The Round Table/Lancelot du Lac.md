> Lancelot is of the many other Knights coerced into undead obedience.  Having been branded a traitor in his final moments, he wants nothing more than to ascend to the afterlife— if there even is one for him— to reunite with Guinivuire.  Arthur keeps him bound for two things; his swordsmanship, and by her cruelty.  This is his eternal punishment for his affair and transgressions against his Kingdom.

Deviating from his Arthurian counterpart, Lancelot kills the sorceress Elaine of Corbenic in his rage, who disguised herself as Guiniviere so that he would lay with her and give her a child.

His Arthurian counterpart illustrates that he spared her for Galahad to be born and raised in a nunnery.  In reality, Lancelot takes Elaine’s corpse to his adoptive mother, Nimue—a Lady of the Lake—and with the help of Merlin and Morgan, they are able to save his son.

Though he demands his son be saved, Lancelot cannot bear to raise him, and soon leaves Galahad’s life as a stranger.  He is not even aware that Galahad is his son.
