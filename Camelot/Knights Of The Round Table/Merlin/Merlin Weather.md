# History

## WITCH HUNTER ERA
As a young man, Merlin was a cruel Witch Hunter who ate the heart of each of his victims.  His dehumanization of sorcerers and sorceresses contributed to his Arthurian counterpart—that of which illustrates him as the child of a demon.

Near the end of his Witch Hunting career, the burden of the lives he had taken became too overwhelming.  

It was then Morgan approached him, took advantage of his vulnerabile and volatile emotional state, and taught him how to make peace with the magick he grappled in his body.

## MAGICAL ADIVISOR ERA
Merlin reformed himself here, becoming the Round Table’s reliable friend and counsel.  As the right hand of the king, he guided Arthur through harsh wars. His heart was softened, but he was far from altruistic, lavishing in luxury and women as he pleased.

As Morgan grew wicked with power, enough to succeed Merlin’s capability by tenfold, he slowly began to fear.

But there was never doubt.  Not yet.

## Doting Father
After stealing Galahad by Arthur’s request from Nimue, he was tasked in raising the doll.  Galahad’s pure nature ebbed off on Merlin, turning a hedonistic soul into one of goodwill.  Merlin sees Lovely as his son; the main driving factor for his will to live and desire to act rogue under Arthur’s nose.

*”Fear grapples even the strongest of men, but I am immune.  Do you know why, Lovely?  Because I know you are safe, and that alone grants me the courage of lions.”*

-   Has lived as long as Morgan thanks to his Magicks, undergoing different identities every era to blend in with humanity
-   In 2893, he freed Lovely from the sleeping spell meant to protect him from Arthur.  
-   He hid Lovely’s body underneath a national museum as a means to convince Arthur that Lovely the Grail had killed him to dissuade her from seeking it out
-   He sent Lovely away to Valhalla to further protect him from Arthur, but with current events, that might not be so easy anymore…

He is mind-broken by Arthur, but he doesn’t know it.  He believes he is immune, and that she believes he’s not.  The reality of it is; Arthur has Merlin on a kill-command which triggers him into obedience.  This command wipes his memory of the event every time.

# Relationships
## [[King Morgan 'Arthur' La Faye]]
+ While he upkeeps his obligation and duties, Merlin attempts all he can to set up seeds for Arthur's fall.  He plays aloof, but in truth, he *fears* Morgan.  He will do what he can to stop her, within self-preservation reasons.

## [[Lancelot du Lac]]
+ Though he dislikes Lancelot for a numerous reasons-- abandoning Lovely being the first-- he thinks not even a wretched man like Lancelot deserves his faith of undying servitude.

## [[Lovely 'Galahad' Weather]]
+ Lovely is of the few things Merlin puts first before his own self-perservation.  Even then, his choice to wake Lovely from his slumber was driven by self-perservation; Arthur was on the crusp of discovering his tomb.  He loves his son deeply, and his current actions are motivated by the desire to be good for Lovely.
