# Abilities
+ Lovely's true power comes from his Helmet. Bestowed upon him by Nimue, it contained the last Vivaines untainted by Arthur.  Ergo, the last remnants of the Ladies' souls that were not stolen by Arthur.
+ He was trained by Gawain, having mastered an array of weapons.  His preferred being the lance.
+ Wearing the helmet gives Lovely the following
	+ The flower petals flood out, fashioning his armour and providing him his halberd.
	+ He reconnects with the souls of the Ladies, allowing them to enter this body.  Their combined souls change his body, granting him added height and a hunched, humanoid form.
	+ He cannot see with the helmet on, following the whispers of the Ladies within the Vivaines to guide him

# History
## Galahad The Doll

![[Pasted image 20221206133947.png]]

Morgan took the lead.  With the limbs of the Ladies of the Lake she had slain to steal Excalibur, she ordered Nimue and Merlin to construct Lancelot’s child anew.  This horrified both Nimue and Merlin, but none could protest.

Using the remains of Lancelot’s unborn son, and that of the Ladies, they forged a new doll, one that would never age—a perfect servant for Arthur’s planned eternity.  

Morgan ripped out the flesh and bone from the limbs, leaving but a few layers of tendon and skin in fear that the wrath of the Ladies would overwhelm the doll.  Merlin provided the doll organs made of cotton and magick, delicately sewn together with felt.  Nimue stitched it together with thread procured from a Deep Dream— vibrant blue.  

When the doll awoke, the room was silent.  Nimue was the most horrified of all three of them.

## Camelot For Galahad

Horrified with what she had done, Nimue prepared to send the doll away to be raised by a nunnery.  Arthur caught wind of this and ordered Merlin to steal the doll with Sir Gawain.  They barely escaped Nimue’s onslaught. 

Galahad excelled.  Quickly rising through the ranks and exceeding Morgan’s expectations, starting by beating Sir Lancelot in a duel.  Morgan conditions him how to think, that his only purpose is to complete prophecies so that he may move on to a blissful life in Heaven as a real human.

>*"It's an indescribable pain.  And I only knew how much it hurt--" his eyes flare as he looks away, "how much I was damaged, until after, for the first time in my life, I was able to make a decision that was mine."  He seethes, "You cannot imagine what having your life at the mercy of somebody else is like."  Lovely's eyes widen the slightest at his tone, and he withdraws in silent apology.  "Mine for the plenty; I've lived by that ever since."*

Lovely breaks free for the first time by refusing to drink from the Holy Grail.  Merlin places him under a sleep spell to protect him and the location of the Grail from Arthur.  He is announced dead, illustrated by Merlin to have died after drinking from the cup to further dissuade Arthur from pursuing it.

## [[King Morgan 'Arthur' Le Fey]]
+ Lovely is fearful of [[King Morgan 'Arthur' Le Fey]].  In recent times has he just realized the extend of Morgan's manipulation, and the weight of the crimes he committed in her name.   While he is prepared to join the cause to kill her, his heart will never be truly in it.
+ Before, Galahad respected his King.  He admired her ambition, and having known nothing else than be a good knight, he did what was asked of him.  This includes finding the Grail.
