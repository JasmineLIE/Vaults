>_I remember when you first came to me, Gawain. Your blood burned with holy fire and you thirsted for purpose. You fell like putty into my hands once you believed I gave you due respects. Imagine my surprise: a knight bound to day working with a witch of the night! It felt an impossible destiny, but it all made sense once I learned you sought your own Dream._ _Do you remember sweet Agravaine? Oh, how his mischief brought you joy! His tongue almost swayed you, but you had forgotten your fury belonged to me. I made you into a man; did you think I could not make you into something less than one, too?_ _I have found a new purpose for you. Just as you turned the Order of the Green a new leaf, so too shall I you._ _For your treachery, I sentence you to forever be left wanting. As long as my beauty shall grace these obsidian halls, you shall be on the cusp of liberty, chasing and screaming for its love, but it shall never hear you. Your innards shall turn to the very embers of day you once bestowed upon your enemies, licking the air for but an ounce of succulent hope._ _And through your screams I will be laughing, watching as you lose yourself to eternity._

• Gawain’s most famous exploit was their battle with the Green Knight; I changed this into the ‘Order of the Green’ which was Arthur’s second culling. They were harvest knights who willingly drank of the Lady of the Lake’s (bath) water and became Dryads, leaving them as a loose end
• Gawain was said to have strength that waxed and waned with the sun, being at its peak at noon— I took this to be witchcraft, and made them a AFAB Trans Man empowered by Arthur 
• Agravaine was said to be one of several brothers, but he had the coolest name so he got the thumbs up to die brutally

+ Taught [[Lovely 'Galahad' Weather]] knightlihood and how to use weapons.
