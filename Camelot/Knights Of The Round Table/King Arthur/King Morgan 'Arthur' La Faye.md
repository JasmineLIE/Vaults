+ Arthur is alive because of her and [[Mordred]]'s battle in [[Avalon]], where both their wills were matched and overwhelmed the Dream, creating a fork, where Arthur was both killed and survived
	+ This is caused by Arthur's refusal to acknowledge her death.  The Dream let Mordred leave Avalon, but not Arthur because of this.
+ Arthur seeks to end the fork so she can be freed from Avalon and return to the material plane to rule.  In this case, the fight between Mordred and Arthur continues in a loop.
