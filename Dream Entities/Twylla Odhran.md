### Twylla's Birth

### The Life of Twylla

### Post-Shapeless

After Aitne Odhran and Sol Odhran's encounter with the [[Shapeless Ones]], Twylla was rewritten to be a real flesh-and-blood girl-- and her meetings with the Odhran twins were erased, leaving her to live a normal life until she seeks them out.

# Relationships
## [[Cordelia Odhran]]

Cordelia created Twylla from her anguish of losing Aitne-- a child born of depressive hate. While she loves Twylla, she sees her as a literal shadow of what he truly wants: her daughter back.

Twylla loves her mother more than anything.

## [[Lucina Odhran]]

Lucina despised Twylla's creation (though she was neutral about the girl herself, as it wasn't her fault), as she was the true ultimate culmination of Cordelia's misshapen journey.

Twylla never met Lucina for more than short spurts, leaving her indeterminate.
